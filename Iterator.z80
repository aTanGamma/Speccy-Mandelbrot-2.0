    MODULE Iterator

Working_X = $80D0   ;Initially copies of Current_X / Current_Y
Working_Y = $80D2   ; Are used each iteration as Z_(-1)

Next_X = $80D4  ;These are used to work out the new x/y positions
Next_Y = $80D6  ;Once calculated, these are moved into copy places for next iteration

X2 = $80D8  ;X^2
Y2 = $80DB  ;Y^2    2 bytes as upper nybble can be ignored here - result <= $6400 from X^2

Iteration = $80DE   ;Iteration counter

Temp_Space = $80F0  ;16 bytes free for general purpose


/*
    General Proc:

    Z1 = Z0^2 + XY

    X' = X^2 - Y^2 + X0

    Y' = 2*X*Y + Y0

    Start calculations 'after' first iteration - Z1 = 0+0j + X+Yj, so Z1 = X+Yj
    For very large coordinates, this immediately rejects them

    Method:

        - Calculate X2 and Y2 from current screen coords (skips first iteration)

    +---> Check if X2 + Y2 > 4
    |     +-> If yes, exit and return iteration number (always 1+)
    |   - Next_X = X2 - Y2 + Current_X
    |   - Next_Y = ((X*Y) << 2) + Current_Y
    |   - Increment iteration counter
    |   - Check if iteration number > _MAX_ITERATIONS
    |     +-> If yes, exit and return iteration number (_MAX_ITERATIONS)
    |   - Calculate X2 and Y2   ; Just hear to even the look of this bit
    +---- Loop
